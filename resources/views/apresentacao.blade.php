            <h2><strong>OQUE É THPLACES </strong></h2>
            is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply a simulation of text from the printing and typesetting industry, and
            has been in use since the 16th century, when an unknown printer took a tray of type and shuffled it to make
            a book of type designs. Lorem Ipsum has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap to desktop
            publishing, remaining essentially unchanged. It became popular in the 60's, when Letraset launched decals
            containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently when it started to be integrated into desktop publishing
            software such as Aldus PageMaker. Why do we use it? It is a known fact that a reader will be distracted by
            the readable text content of a page when examining its layout. The advantage of using Lorem Ipsum is that it
            has a normal distribution of letters, as opposed to "Content here, content here", making it look like
            readable text. Many publishing software and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default template
            text, and a quick search for 'lorem ipsum' will show many websites still in their construction phase.
            Several new versions have appeared over the years, occasionally by accident, and sometimes on purpose
            (injecting humour, and the like). Where does he come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not
            simply random text. Over 2000 years old, its roots can be found in a work of classical Latin literature
            dating back to 45 BC. Richard McClintock, a professor of Latin at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
            researched one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a passage in Lorem Ipsum, and, looking
            through citations of the word in classical literature, discovered its undoubted significance. origin. Lorem
            Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of Cicero's "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of
            Good and Evil), written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics that was very popular in
            the Renaissance era. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem Ipsum dolor sit amet..." comes from a line in
            section 1.10.32. The original standard excerpt from Lorem Ipsum,is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply a
